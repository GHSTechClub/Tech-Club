            <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>We meet on Thursdays in room 540 during lunch. We generally discuss upcoming events and club-related news and then hang out and discuss tech topics or help each other with projects. Special meetings, such as those held for students working on the website, occur after school and are usually dedicated to a certain topic in tech.</p>
            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>The club has collective projects that members can choose to work on. These are distinctly different from individual projects that exist outside of Tech Club. Here is a list of current projects that students in Tech Club are working on together:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Tech Club Website</strong>: the site you see before you was made entirely by students in Tech Club and is maintained by them as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Events</h3>
            <p>Types of events we typically have or are interested in having:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Speakers (professionals with experience in a tech field comes in and talks to club members about their job)</li>
                <li>Competitions (students in the club compete either with one another or with students from outside the club in some kind of tech-related competition)</li>
                <li>Tours of tech facilities</li>
